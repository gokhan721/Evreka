1-) "Deletion of expired data" Suggestion:

- "custom management commands" link: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/howto/custom-management-commands

- Django support "custom management commands".
Class can be written with extending BaseCommand to delete expired data.
Expired data can be sent to elasticsearch to log.


2-) Kafka + Apache Spark + ElasticSearch Suggestion:

- Assuming vehicle data is log data. Vehicle data might be collected in Kafka brokers with "vehicle plate" topic.
Then, processing data in parallel with Apache Spark to get navigation records and sent it to elastichsearch
with "navigation_record" index. Getting sent data in last 48 hours by using Elasticsearch Query DSL via Postman,
Logstash with grok or web-services. Kibana can be used for data visualization.

Elasticsearch Range Query DSL: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-range-query.html


- Elasticsearch is replaced with mongoDB if navigation record data should be stored in database.
